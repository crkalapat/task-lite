# Task Lite

Task Lite is designed to be a minimal, simple, and lightweight task tracker. To use it, simply hit "New Task" and input any relevant information for the task. The tasks will automatically populate the screen dynamically. To get rid of any task, hit the close button or X on the task.

Side Note: This project is my submission to my Web and Mobile Applications class semester one-pager challenge, which is why there is just one HTML file with everything embedded in it.
